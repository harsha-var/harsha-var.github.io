                        <p> THOR.The son of Odin uses his mighty abilities as the God of 
                        Thunder to protect his home Asgard and planet Earth alike.
                        Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and banished to Earth by Odin.
                        While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.

                 <p>  Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, 
                        a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries,
                         a company originally started by his father, Howard Stark.
                          A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men, and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, 
                        Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors.

              <p>  Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers.
                As someone who was highly respected for his work regarding biochemistry, 
                nuclear physics, and gamma radiation, he was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to 
                recreate the Super Soldier Serum which created Captain America, although Ross elected not to inform
                Banner what he was creating.
                However, when an exposure to high levels of gamma radiation instead of vita radiation went awry,
                the mild-mannered scientist had found that when angered, provoked
                 or excited, he would transform into the huge, rage-fueled, nearly mindless creature known as Hulk.

              <p>   Natalia Alianovna "Natasha" Romanoff, 
               also known as Black Widow, was one of the most talented spies and
               assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers.
               Originally an agent of the Soviet agency for foreign intelligence,
               the KGB, she later became a member of S.H.I.E.L.D., 
               the international counter-intelligence agency.
               Having extensive mastery in martial arts and armed with her Widow's Bite,
               Black Widow became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient agents.
               During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark Industries to watch Tony Stark due to fears that he was dying.
               During this mission, Romanoff assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko's terrorist plots against him.

                Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran, 
                a founding member of the Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero. 
                Rogers had suffered from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, was rejected from military service despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve.
                Determined to serve, Rogers ultimately volunteered for the Project Rebirth, which enhanced the frail Rogers' body to the peak of human physicality. Mistrusted by Colonel Chester Phillips, the head of the SSR, Rogers was relegated to propaganda campaigns, and was given the new moniker of Captain America.
                Rogers later joined the war with a combat role after he single-handedly liberated captured Allied prisoners of war.
